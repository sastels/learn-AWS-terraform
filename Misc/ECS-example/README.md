## Description

- A web server running in ECS 

## Usage

```
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Now build and push the demo Node app's docker image to ECR by following the steps outlined in the repo's *View Push Commands*

You should be able to (perhaps after a slight wait) go the load balancer's *DNS name*.
